# Portfolio

This is a repo where I store the source code of my personal portfolio, so I can then deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and make it publicly available, using my custom domain - [https://dpaulos6.xyz/](https://dpaulos6.xyz).

## Inspiration / Meaning

This website is an attempt to describe who I am as a person, using a color palette I truly find relaxing. All of the content included and design of the website is as much unique as my creativity allows, trying to reflect my style and vibe.

<!-- The works included were made by me, some of them were projects of my own ideas, some of them were internship or real client projects. -->

## Development

This project was built using Vite and React + TypeScript, and below are the steps to run it locally on your system.

### Warn: Install the package manager, if not already

This project uses a package managere called `pnpm`, which will require it to be installed on your OS to correctly setup the project.

If you don't have it installed, I wont guide you through the installation of `pnpm`, but you can follow their [documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Install dependencies

This step is mandatory because the modules folder is not included in the repository, and this command will install every module locally on your project's root folder.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the development server

This command will allow you to preview the website and all changes you make in real time.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Errors during setup

If any errors occur to you during the setup of the process, please research about the errors or refer to [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

If you've researched about the errors and, in extreme case, had to contact support, and you're still encountering errors, create an issue on this repository and I will do my best to help you.

## Contributing

This is a special project, as it will reflect my person on a website, but if you have a suggestion or can help me improve something about the website, please see my contacts and talk directly with me before attempting pull requests.

Alternatively, you can create an issue and include `Contributing:` at the start of the title.
